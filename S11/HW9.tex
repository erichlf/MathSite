\begin{problem}[1.]
	Air is pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of $20\text{ cm}^3$ per minute. How
	fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diameter is $10$ cm?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[2.]
	A 10-foot ladder is resting against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is
	initially 3 feet away from the wall, and is being pulled away from the wall at
	a rate of $\sfrac{1}{3}$ feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder
	moving after 4 seconds?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[3.]
	Boat A is traveling east at 30 knots. Boat B is traveling south at 40 knots.
	Suppose the boats are both headed to the same point. How fast is their
	distance from each other decreasing when boat A is 5 nautical miles from its
	destination and boat B is 12 nautical miles from its destination?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[4.]
	Suppose you are sitting on the ground watching a plane flying towards you. The
	plane is flying level at 5000 ft and is traveling 600 mph. If $\theta$ is the
	angle between the ground and your line of sight to the plane, at what rate is
	this angle changing the instant the plane is 5000 ft from you along the
	ground.
